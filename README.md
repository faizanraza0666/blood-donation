# blood-donation

We intend to create a web application called "Blood Bank Management System."
This programme will act as a go-between for patients and blood banks, both
public and private. Both an appropriate frontend and a backend that uses APIs
will be used. We believe that the V-shaped model will be used to the project in
order to appropriately test and process each endpoint. Initial development and
testing will focus on the frontend in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The backend
will then be developed and tested using Postman utilising node.js, express.js,
and APIs. Once correctly integrated and tested, the frontend and backend will be
deployed together. After investigating and fixing the issues, a comprehensive
test will be conducted on the entire programme.
